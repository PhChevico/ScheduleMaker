# ScheduleMaker

## Overview
ScheduleMaker is an intelligent, agentic AI designed to optimize employee scheduling by analyzing various factors such as employee availability, weather conditions, local events, and business needs. It ensures optimal workforce distribution while reducing scheduling conflicts and inefficiencies.
Developed in just 7 hours during a hackathon.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Scheduling** – Automatically generates employee schedules based on real-time data.
- **Dynamic Adaptability** – Adjusts schedules in response to external factors like weather and local concerts.
- **Employee Availability Integration** – Ensures fair and efficient scheduling based on inputted availability.
- **Event Awareness** – Analyzes local events to anticipate surges or declines in demand.
- **Business Optimization** – Balances labor costs with workforce efficiency.

## How It Works
1. **Input Data** – Provide employee availability, business hours, and other preferences.
2. **External Factor Analysis** – ScheduleMaker pulls data on weather, events, and other regional factors.
3. **AI Processing** – The system generates an optimal schedule using machine learning algorithms.
4. **Review & Adjust** – Managers can review and modify the suggested schedule if needed.
5. **Deploy & Notify** – Employees receive automated schedule notifications.
